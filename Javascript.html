    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>Javascript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.</p>
  <h2>Javascript Programms</h2>  
  <p>
    JavaScript is a powerful and flexible programming language. It can execute on a web browser that allows us to make interactive webpages such as popup menus, animations, form validation, etc.
  </p>
  <h2>Javascript Statement</h2>
  <p>
    JavaScript Statements. JavaScript statements are the commands to tell the browser to what action to perform. Statements are separated by semicolon (;). JavaScript statement constitutes the JavaScript code which is translated by the browser line by line.
  </p>
  <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
  <p>
    Keywords are reserved words that are part of the syntax in the programming language. For example, const a = 'hello'; Here, const is a keyword that denotes that a is a constant.
  </p>
  <h2>console.log</h2>
  <p>
    The console. log() is a function in JavaScript that is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. Syntax: console. log("");
  </p>
  <p>JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types:</p>
  <body>
    <ul>
        <li>string</li>
        <li>number</li>
        <li>boolean</li>
        <li>biglnt</li>
        <li>Undefined</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>object</li>
        <li>symbol</li>
    </ul>
</body>
<h3>String</h3>
<p>
    A string is a sequence of one or more characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols. 
</p>
<h3>Number</h3>
<p>
    The JavaScript Number type is a double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value, like double in Java or C#. This means it can represent fractional values
</p>
<h3>Boolean</h3>
<p>
    In JavaScript, a boolean value is one that can either be TRUE or FALSE. If you need to know “yes” or “no” about something, then you would want to use the boolean function.
</p>
<h3>Biglnt</h3>
<p>
    JavaScript BigInt variables are used to store big integer values that are too big to be represented by a normal JavaScript Number .
</p>
<h3>Undefined</h3>
<p>
    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined . A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value.
</p>
<h3>Null</h3>
<p>
    In JavaScript, null is a special value that represents an empty or unknown value. For example, let number = null; The code above suggests that the number variable is empty at the moment and may have a value later.
</p>
<h3>Object</h3>
<p>
    In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc.
</p>
<h3>Symbol</h3>
<p>
    Symbols are often used to add unique property keys to an object that won't collide with keys any other code might add to the object, and which are hidden from any mechanisms other code will typically use to access the object.
</p>

<h2>Identifier</h2>
<p>
    Identifiers are JavaScript names. Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions. 
    Variable: to store data
                - const/let/var Variable-name
                - Variable-name = value
                <br>
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
variable declaration. 
</p>


<p>
There are three types of keywords for a variable declaration in JS: var, let, and const. var x; const y; let z; Var - It is an outdated keyword in Javascript. We cannot declare a variable without var in older browsers.
</p>

<h3>Var</h3>
<p>
    var is the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable. x is the name of that variable. = is the operator that tells JavaScript a value is coming up next. 100 is the value for the variable to store.
</p>

<h3>Let</h3>
<p>
    The keyword let in Javascript is used to declare a variable that is block scoped in JavaScript. In JavaScript, the var keyword is typically used to declare a variable that is treated like any other variable, whereas variables declared using the let in JavaScript are block scoped.
</p>

<h3>const</h3>
<p>
    Const is another keyword to declare a variable when you do not want to change the value of that variable for the whole program. 
</p>

<h2>JavaScript Expressions</h2>
<p>
    An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value. The computation is called an evaluation. The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
</p>

<h2>Javascript Operators</h2>
<p>
    Operators are used to performing specific mathematical and logical computations on operands. 
</p>
 
<h2>Javascript Operands</h2>
<p>
    The operator operand form is called a prefix unary operator, and the operand operator form is called a postfix unary operator. ++ and -- are the only postfix operators in JavaScript — all other operators, like ! , typeof , etc.
